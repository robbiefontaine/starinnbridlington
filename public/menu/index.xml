      <description>WINE LIST
RED WINE. (Price per bottle)
Rioja Santiago Tempranillo £14
Founded in 1870 in Haro, Rioja Santiago is the second oldest winery in La Rioja. One of only three wineries in the world that, due to its age, are permitted to use the word ‘Rioja’ on the label. Nowadays Rioja Santiago is a modern winery, but the philosophy that surrounded the wines for more than 100 years has not changed: producing the highest quality Rioja wines.</description>
