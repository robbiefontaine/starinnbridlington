## RED WINE (Price per bottle) 

Rioja Santiago Tempranillo  **£14**

_Founded in 1870 in Haro, Rioja Santiago is the second oldest winery in La Rioja. One of only three wineries in the world that, due to its age, are permitted to use the word ‘Rioja’ on the label. Nowadays Rioja Santiago is a modern winery, but the philosophy that surrounded the wines for more than 100 years has not changed: producing the highest quality Rioja wines. Winemaker: Carmelo Angulo_

The Black Craft. Shiraz by Magpie estate **£20**

_The Magpie Estate 'The Black Craft' Shiraz is classic Barossa Shiraz with intense savoury flavours of thick blackberry compote, black pepper and typical iron-rich beefy flavours. Not a hint of jam here, no sweetness, this is serious shiraz for grown-ups with balanced acidity, fine velvety tannins and tremendous length_

Valpolicella Ripasso Superiore **£22**

_La Casetta is a Valpolicella Ripasso with a difference. Most Valpolicella Ripassos are made by adding the leftover skins from Amarone production to standard Valpolicella. But with La Casetta, they go a step further. They add the skins from Recioto, a rare sweet wine which is so intense it makes Amarone look light and fresh. When the leftover skins are added to the mix, it pushes it into another dimension of flavour. Bright red cherry. Plum. Dried fruit. It’s fantastically full with a really plush texture. Perfect with mushrooms or game. This is what leading US wine critic James Suckling said about it: “Succulent and rich with layers of dried fruit and spices. Intense and flavourful. Drink now.”_

Amancaya Gran Reserva Malbec Cabernet Sauvignon **£25**

_Argentinian Wine. Deep colour with ruby and violet hints.The nose presents aromas of cloves, white pepper, and ripe raspberry fruit. The sleek chocolate and tobacco finish has a pleasant racy edge. A nice lick of oak on the palate with well structured tannins. Great length on the finish. A lot of wine for the money._

Chateaux neuf du pape Pasquior desrignes 1440 **£38**

_The literal translation of Châteauneuf-du-Pape is "Pope's new castle” due to several popes making their summer home here during the Middle Ages. It can also be credited for putting the AOC (appellation d'origine contrôlée) system in place to signify quality wine. There are 13 grape varieties authorized for the red wines. All contribute something to the finished wine, whether it is color, fragrance or structure. The main red grapes are Grenache rouge, Mourvèdre and Syrah, which contribute spice and gamey aromas and flavors. The rare white wines are produced primarily from Grenache blanc, Clairette, Bourboulenc, and Roussanne grapes. Only six percent of production is white, and they can be difficult to find. If you are able to get a hold of a bottle, expect it to be full-bodied and rich. Some wines are early drinking, but many can age up to 30 years. Look for the coat of arms with a papal crest embossed on the shoulder of the bottle; this symbol signifies estate-bottled wines._

## WHITE WINE

Villa borghetti Pinot Grigio delle venezie **£14**

_Delle Venezie is an incredibly popular and recognizable IGT (Indicazione Geografica Tipica) due to its large production and exportation of refreshing, crisp white wines produced from the Pinot Grigio grape. Situated in northeastern Italy, the “Venezie” is representative of the “Tre Venezie” (or Three Venices), a reference to the three modern regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, and Trentino-Aldo-Adige that once were part of the Venetian Empire. Pinot Grigio wines reign supreme here, however additional red and white wines are produced from Garganega, Malvasia, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc and Verduzzo grapes._

Vega de la neina Rueda Vardejo. **£16**

_The Bodega Vega de la Reina vineyard is located in Valdestillas in the province of Valladolid, on the banks of the rivers Duero and Adaja. The Bodega Vega de la Reina property covers more than 100 hectares, at average altitude of 740m above sea level, in an area of clearly continental climate. The soil, of alluvial origin, has a markedly sandy and stony texture at the surface, and is very suited for vine cultivation, particularly for the Verdejo variety, which is native to the Rueda district.
