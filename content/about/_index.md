Historically,  The Ye Olde Star Inn in Old Town Bridlington was not any old pub.  It's frontage belied its size as it sat on an acre of land with parking for 60 plus vehicles.  Back in the day, it was **the** place to eat,  hold weddings, birthdays, and events.  It had the largest and finest kitchen in the area. It had the finest food to wow your guests and the finest staff. It had the finest rooms and it had the finest function room.  Over time, lack of investment, neglect, cheap supermarket alcohol, and incompetent management led to its demise and subsequent sale to a well-funded property investment company. That company now ensures the continued presence of "The Star Inn" for decades to come unlike other venues run by ever-changing staff and closures. Your event planning and deposit are as safe here as The Bank of England.

After great discussion, planning, foresight, and a Â£400k refurbishment The Star Inn is back at the pinnacle of hospitality! With all of the above just like it had years ago... but with a modern twist!

For your information, at this present point in time, we have decided to operate as an adults only venue, this has been a decision made considering many internal and external factors, and one we hope you'll understand. For similar reasons, with the exception of assistance dogs, we are no longer allowing dogs inside the building.
