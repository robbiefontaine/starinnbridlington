**We are an outside only venue up until May 17 2021. We have close to 20 outside tables which gives us a current capacity of approximately 70.**

For your information, at this present point in time, we have decided to operate as an adults only venue, this has been a decision made considering many internal and external factors, and one we hope you'll understand.

For similar reasons, with the exception of assistance dogs, we are no longer allowing dogs inside the building. We do know that you all love your dogs, and we love Dogs too, so you are more than welcome to have your Dog's with you in our beautiful newly created outside space, where we'll be more than happy to offer them a lovely drop of water and the odd doggy treat.
