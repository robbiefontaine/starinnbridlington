**We are a table service only for the foreseeable future. Our customers are now able to sit inside as well as outside (20 tables). Up to 6 persons from a different household are permitted at a single table. Track and trace measures will be in place. Facemasks must be worn when not seated.**

For your information, at this present point in time, we have decided to operate as an adults only venue, this has been a decision made considering many internal and external factors, and one we hope you'll understand.

For similar reasons, with the exception of assistance dogs, we are no longer allowing dogs inside the building. We do know that you all love your dogs, and we love Dogs too, so you are more than welcome to have your Dog's with you in our beautiful newly created outside space, where we'll be more than happy to offer them a lovely drop of water and the odd doggy treat.
