**Welcome back to the "old normal". ðŸ‘Š
You will not require a face covering to enter but we won't judge if you still want to. You will not be required to scan or sign in upon arrival. We are still encouraging orders from the table and are happy to serve you at your table as much as we can but you can also now order at the bar. No standing though please!**

For your information, at this present point in time, we have decided to operate as an adults only venue, this has been a decision made considering many internal and external factors, and one we hope you'll understand.

For similar reasons, with the exception of assistance dogs, we are no longer allowing dogs inside the building. We do know that you all love your dogs, and we love dogs too, so you are more than welcome to have your dogs with you in our beautiful newly created outside space, where we'll be more than happy to offer them a lovely drop of water and the odd doggy treat.
