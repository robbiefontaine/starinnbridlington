We have a beautiful public house, main bar and oak cocktail bar, attached to our lavish restaurant, lounge. A small hotel, and our bespoke "copper room" vaulted party suite complete with stage PA and laser lighting.    We have an outside decked terrace area that absorbs the afternoon sun from its Southwest facing position.  A perfect place for your guests to be seated on summer days, either under our sun awnings or out enjoying the sun's heat.  Our venue is simply spectacular and will wow your guests better than any other choice. Our entire site can cater up to 150 guests!  We also - on occasions - have closed the pub for private eventing giving your guests of differing age groups rooms of different decor and music tastes a choice of where to be.  Every one of your guests is looked after to the best of our ability and that is the measure of success of your event.  Your guests need to be telling you months after your party that they so much enjoyed it and they will, having been here.  

We have reviewed and looked at the array of options for our events, be they weddings or parties.  By keeping it simple we fall in line with present party policy and budget.   We have decided a spectacular hog roast is a way a ahead for all our functions,  with all the theatre of a skilled chef carving the meat!  We have therefore arranged to price for such on a see as you read basis. Below are the following options ;- 
 
**Up to 75 guests | Between 1st Oct and 30th May | Price is £995.**

**Up to 75 guests | Between 1st Jun and 30th Sep | Price is £1295.**
