title: THE STAR INN
---

The Star Inn is a 17th century listed Coaching Inn, located In Bridlington's cosmopolitan Old town but only a mile and half from the harbour and the commercial area of Bridlington on the East Coast of Yorkshire. The pub's frontal white wath and timber appearance, belies it's size. A huge carpark to the rear surrounds the Star Hotel extension. This boasts en suite rooms and all modern hotel facilities one would expect. A quiet South West facing sun terrace for a summer's afternoon drink comes free, as does a secure flood lit 40 vehicle car park. Although in modern times we have to accept tv's and sky sports the pub is thriving and is where English Civil War Cavaliers, Dick Turpin and more recently, WW2 Bomber command aircrew once took their ale ! Our history tends to be unique in the area. The old town of Bridlington is self contained, boasting numerous restaurants and welcoming pubs providing live music and a great atmosphere on weekends, yet a sedate and slower pace during the weekdays. In short, a welcome respite from the commercial sector of Bridlington located in the harbour area but a short distance away.
