Keith, Leigh, Jodie and the team welcome you to the Star Inn located in the historic Old Town of Bridlington.  We are a traditional Old English pub, steeped in history and we hope you enjoy your visit with us.  With a wide selection of draught available, including some of the finest bitters, we also have a wonderful Cocktail and Gin Bar for you to enjoy, so whether you're looking for a lovely pint in front of the fire, or a summer Cocktail sat outside on our beautiful new decked area, we're sure you'll have a wonderful experience.  Whatever your reason for visiting, a stay in the hotel, a meal in the restaurant, or just a quick drink, we'll welcome you with some of Yorkshire's famous hospitality.

For your information, we have decided to operate as an **adults only** venue, this has been a decision made considering many internal and external factors, and one we hope you'll understand.

For similar reasons, with the exception of assistance Dogs, we are no longer allowing Dogs inside the building.  We do know that you all love your dog's, and we love dogs too, so you are more than welcome to have your dog's with you in our beautiful newly created outside space, where we'll be more than happy to offer them a lovely drop of water and the odd doggy treat!
